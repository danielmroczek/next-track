# Next Track â€” Album Suggestion Tool

A web-based album suggestion tool that randomly selects and displays albums from curated music charts (e.g., Rolling Stone 500, Porcys Top 100, Z Archiwum Polskiego Beatu). It fetches album cover art from public music metadata and cover-art APIs and provides direct links to streaming services for easy listening.

## Project Origin
As a passionate music enthusiast, I enjoy discovering new albums but don't always have the time. When I do (often during small pauses like loading the dishwasher) I sometimes struggle to decide what to play. This app was created to solve that: it randomly selects an album from several curated lists of noteworthy records, offering a ready-made listening choice when I want something new.

## Usage
- Open the app in a modern browser.
- Select a chart and request a random album suggestion.
- Use history controls to copy or remove entries.

## Notes
- Built with Alpine.js and styled with Pico CSS
- Implementation uses public music metadata/cover-art endpoints; ensure any required API keys or usage terms are handled securely in code.
